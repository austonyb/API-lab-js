1. Post request takes queries and body posts. Body must be in JSON.
2. Get request sends back JSON.
3. https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/?id=555
4. Possible response codes are: 
        200 (successful, returns array of filterd posts)
        409 (Request query is missing required text property.)

5. Create a post whose text is your name, record the URL and body here:
    URL = https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/
    Body = 
    {
        "text": "Auston"
    }

6. What would the URL and body object be to update the post you just made to contain your faovrite color instead of your name?
    URL = (PUT) https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/
        {
        "text": "red"
        }
7. What is the URL to get posts that contain the text “blue”?
    https://practiceapi.devmountain.com/api/posts/filter/?text=blue

8. Make a request to GET all the posts. What are the content type and charset of the response? (Hint: look on the Headers)
    content type: application/json
    charset: utf-8

9. What would cause a PUT request to return a 409 status?
    missing req.query.id or req.body.text

10. What happens if you try to send a query in the GET request URL? Why do you get that response?
    It sends over everything. Perhaps the endpoint isn't set up on the backend?
